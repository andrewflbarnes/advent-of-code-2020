### Requirements

Most challenges have solutions written in multiple languages, each with their own pre-reqs. These are listed
below, ordered by most commonly used (most common first):
- rust - requires `rustc`
    - alternatively you can `cargo init`, add a `[[bin]]` entry and run `cargo r input` or equivalent
- javascript - requires `node` (tested on `14.15.1`)
    - can be run as scripts (e.g. `./solution.js`) if node is on the `PATH`
- c - requires a compiler like `gcc`
- shell - should work on most shells but safest on `bash 5` to account for bash-isms and associateive arrays
